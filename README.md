# Applied Data Science Nanodegree at Udacity

This repo contains projects and study notes/useful codes along my study with the second term of Applied Data Science nanodegree at Udacity. 

The repo contains: 

1. **[A Data Blog Post](https://github.com/bobbleoxs/data_science/tree/master/Data%20Blog%20ADIMA)** 

    In this project, I used the the Analytical Database of Individual Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) and their Affiliates (ADIMA) dataset from OECD to understand the structure and presence of the top 100 MNEs of our time across the world.

2. **[Data Engineering - Disaster Response Pipeline](https://github.com/bobbleoxs/data_science/tree/master/Disater_response_pipeline)**

    In this project, I carried out data engineering processes to create a web app which classifies disaster messages into 32 categories to help the aid workers to assort messages received during catastrophic events to the most relevant teams. The dataset was provided by [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/). 
    
3. **[Experimental Design and Recommendations - IBM Watson Studio](https://github.com/bobbleoxs/data_science/tree/master/Recommendations_with_IBM_learning_platform)**
    
    In this project, I built a recommendation engine to provide most relevant articles to users on IBM Watson Studio's learning platform.  The data is provided by IBM Watson studio.
    
4. **[Capstone Project - Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Sensory Data](https://github.com/bobbleoxs/data_science/tree/master/Project%20-%20capstone%20HAR)**

    In this project, I used a dataset collected from users wearing smartphone to classify, cluster and predict what human activities are carried out (e.g. stand, sit, lie, walk) for further decision making. The dataset was archived on [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
